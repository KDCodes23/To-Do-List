ðŸš€ 100 Days of Code - Full Stack Challenge
Welcome to the 100 Days of Code - Full Stack Challenge! This journey is all about coding every day and building projects using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Dart/Flutter, and Java to become a better full-stack developer.

ðŸ“… Project Log
Day 1 - Project: To-Do List (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
For the first day of the challenge, I built a To-Do List application to kick things off with core web technologies.

Project Overview
Description: A simple, interactive to-do list that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Itâ€™s built with HTML5 for the structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript to handle interactivity.

Key Features
Add New Task: Users can type a new task into an input field and add it to the list.
Mark as Completed: Click on a task to toggle its completed state with a strikethrough effect.
Delete Task: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
Key Learnings
JavaScript DOM Manipulation: Practiced using JavaScript to create elements, add event listeners, and update the DOM dynamically.
CSS Flexbox & Styling: Used Flexbox to align items and create a simple, clean layout for the task list.
User Interaction Handling: Added event listeners to handle task completion and deletion.
Code Highlights

Here's a short code snippet for adding a new task:


Challenges
Handling empty tasks and preventing them from being added.
Ensuring the UI was responsive and the styles looked consistent across different screen sizes.
